WhazzerFinger allows screen captures and video recording of the iOS Simulator.

Check out a video made with WhazzerFinger / iMovie here: http://youtu.be/Z3W-qU5EP4A.

# Overlays

The application adds an overlay on top of the actual simulator window to give it a more realistic look.
At the moment only iPhone is supported in portrait or landscape mode.
iPad should come in the next releases. 

# Video recording

When recording, video frames are stored to RAM in order to avoid frame drops.
The maximum length of a video recording depends on the RAM available on the system.

# Encoding

Screenshots and videos are stored on the desktop.
Videos are encoded using H.264 codec.

# SimFinger

WhazzerFinger was inspired by the original SimFinger application (https://github.com/atebits/SimFinger).
